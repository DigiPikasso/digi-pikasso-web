augustinus has an inherent passion for africa, thanks to his upbringing in various towns along the east african coast. coming of age in an era when both wildlife and the wilderness seemed vast and limitless, the experiences of his youth had a powerful influence on his understanding and passion for the natural surroundings. similarly strong is his natural talent for painting, and despite a short stint studying and working as geologist, in 1979, augustinus took the plunge to take on painting as a full-time profession, and spent the better part of the following eight years living and painting in the wildest parts of northern botswana. he has since expanded his collection by setting up camp and documenting other parts of the african wilderness, as well as alaska, and over the past forty years dedicated his time to reflect a personal experience living and painting in nature. augustinus' works are represented in private and public collections across the world, depicting what he calls, “the romance of wild country”. the fnb collection holds ten of augustinus' paintings."},{"id":3,"firstName":"dieter","lastName":"aschenborn","countryOfOrigin":"namibia","mainArtType":"contemporary

embedded in what has been dubbed an intrinsically social, cultural and spiritual context. having mastered his creative talent at the formative john muafangejo art centre in windhoek, the artist expresses himself through etching, drawing, painting, three-dimensional design and a range of graphic techniques. for narrative subjects, he prefers an expression in black and white linocuts, and with linear drawings remaining his most accomplished medium, karuseb's linocuts bear evidence of an artist who has mastered both the technical and conceptual aspects of printmaking. his more recent works present a series of colourful object, mono and linocut prints, remaining true to his experimental nature and exploration of various artistic techniques. having lived in berlin, germany, for a notable
